# Java Mastery Journey

A disciplined, end-to-end learning repository focused on achieving **deep, production-grade mastery of Java**, modern Java (8+ / 11), JDBC, Spring, and Spring Boot through **daily practice, system-building, and measurable progress**.

This repository is intentionally structured as a **learning system**, not a collection of random code snippets.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Master **Core Java** from first principles
- Develop strong **OOP and problem-solving ability**
- Gain real-world experience with **Collections, Concurrency, and JVM internals**
- Build production-ready systems using **Spring & Spring Boot**
- Deliver **2 milestone projects** equivalent to ~2–3 years of industry experience
- Maintain a **public, auditable learning log** with daily commits

---

## 🧭 Learning Philosophy

- **Correctness before speed**
- **Depth over breadth**
- **Systems thinking over tutorials**
- **Discipline beats motivation**

No topic is skipped. No shortcuts are taken.
