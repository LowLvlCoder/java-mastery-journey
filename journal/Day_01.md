# Day 1 - Java Core Foundations

Date: 06/07/2026

Focus: Java environment setup, program structure, primitives, operators, conditionals.

## 🎯 Objectives for the Day

- Set up Java development environment correctly
- Understand how a Java program starts and executes
- Gain hands-on fluency with primitive data types and variables
- Practice conditional logic using if / else
- Build confidence compiling and running Java programs via CLI

## ✅ What I Completed

- Installed and verified JDK 25
- Successfully compiled and executed Java programs using javac and java
- Practiced Java program structure (class, main method)
- Worked with all Java primitive data types and String
- Explored:
  - Type casting (widening & narrowing)
  - Integer overflow
  - Floating-point precision differences
- Implemented conditional logic using relational and logical operators

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Java is strictly typed — explicit conversions matter
- Integer division behaves differently from floating-point division
- && and || are short-circuit operators
- Java program execution always begins at main
- Small syntax mistakes compound quickly if fundamentals are weak

## 🧪 Practice Problems Solved

1. Printed JVM version and vendor details
1. Swapped two integers (with and without temp variable)
1. Checked even vs odd numbers
1. Found largest of three numbers using conditional logic
1. Calculated simple interest
1. Classified characters (alphabet, digit, special)
1. Implemented leap year logic
1. Built a basic calculator using operators
1. Printed ASCII values
1. Demonstrated integer vs floating-point division trap

All problems compiled and executed successfully via command line.

## 🚧 Challenges Faced

- Slower coding speed due to avoiding IDE autocomplete
- Required conscious attention to syntax and type correctness

## 📈 Outcome

Day 1 established a solid mechanical base for Java.

Focus was correctness over speed. Ready to move into loops and iteration-heavy problem solving next.

## 🔜 Next Day Plan (Day 2)

- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Pattern problems
- Brute-force logical thinking
- Building iteration intuition
