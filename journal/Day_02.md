# 📅 Day 2 — Loops, Iteration Thinking, and Control Flow

Date: 09/07/2026

Focus: Loop fundamentals, iteration models, nested loops, and production-level loop reasoning

## 🎯 Objectives for the Day

- Master loop execution flow (init → condition → body → update)
- Choose appropriate loop constructs (for, while, do-while)
- Eliminate off-by-one errors and infinite loops
- Translate real-world requirements into correct iteration logic
- Learn how loop bugs manifest in production systems

## ✅ What I Completed

- Studied and traced loop execution step-by-step before running code
- Practiced for, while, and do-while loops and converted between them
- Implemented counting, reverse counting, and aggregation loops
- Built logic for:
  - Digit counting
  - Number reversal
  - Palindrome checks
  - Prime number validation
  - Fibonacci series
- Solved multiple nested loop pattern problems
- Analyzed real production scenarios involving infinite loops and off-by-one errors

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Loop correctness depends on alignment of initialization, condition, and update
- Off-by-one errors are more dangerous than syntax errors
- continue and break can silently alter loop termination behavior
- Iterative solutions are safer than recursion for unbounded input
- Production loop bugs often stem from missing updates or incorrect boundaries

## 🧪 Practice Problems Solved

1. Print numbers from 1 to N
1. Reverse counting from N to 1
1. Sum of first N natural numbers
1. Count digits in a number
1. Reverse a number
1. Check numeric palindrome
1. Prime number validation
1. Factorial calculation
1. Pattern printing using nested loops
1. Fibonacci series generation

All programs compiled and executed successfully via CLI.

## 🏭 Production Scenarios Studied

- Infinite loops caused by missing state updates
- Data loss due to incorrect loop boundaries in paginated processing
- Importance of loop invariants and defensive termination checks

## 🚧 Challenges Faced

- Slower reasoning when manually tracing nested loops
- Required disciplined thinking to avoid premature execution without mental simulation

## 📈 Outcome

- Developed iteration discipline and stronger confidence in debugging loop-heavy logic.
- Ready to apply loops safely in real-world data processing and backend workflows.

## 🔜 Next Day Plan (Day 2)

- Arrays and array traversal
- Searching, aggregation, and boundary safety
- Loop + array fusion patterns
